# Non-ideal-QKDNs
Using NetSquid, we provide a framework for simulating non ideal quantum communications and quantum cryptographic protocols.

In addition to standard Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`), this project also uses third-party code from GitHub repositories, including:

- [`qiskit-metal`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal) – for designing and analyzing quantum hardware
- [`quantum-hacks-lib`](https://github.com/username/quantum-hacks-lib) – for implementing adversarial quantum protocols
